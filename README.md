# Reward Points Service

## Overview
The Reward Points Service is a Spring Boot application that calculates reward points for customers based on their transactions. Customers earn points for every dollar spent over $50, with additional points for amounts over $100. The service provides endpoints to retrieve reward points for individual customers as well as all customers within a specified date range.

The project is organized into the following packages:

- **controller**: Contains the REST controllers that handle HTTP requests and responses.
- **service**: Defines the service interfaces.
- **serviceImpl**: Implements the service interfaces.
- **dao**: Contains the repository interfaces for database access.
- **model**: Defines the data models used in the application.

## Implementation Details

### RewardController
The `RewardController` class provides endpoints to get reward points for a specific customer or all customers within a date range.

- **Endpoints**:
  - `GET /rewards/points/{customerId}`: Retrieves reward points for a specific customer within a date range.

- **Methods**:
  - `getRewardPoints`: Validates and adjusts the date range, calculates reward points for a specific customer, and returns the result.

### RewardService
The `RewardService` interface defines methods for calculating reward points.

- **Methods**:
  - `getRewardPoints`: Validates and adjusts the date range, calculates reward points for a specific customer, and returns the result.

### RewardServiceImpl
The `RewardServiceImpl` class implements the `RewardService` interface.

- **Methods**:
  - `calculatePoints`: Calculates reward points based on the transaction amount. Customers receive 2 points for every dollar spent over $100 and 1 point for every dollar spent between $50 and $100.
  - `calculateMonthlyPoints`: Retrieves transactions for a specific customer within a date range, calculates monthly and total reward points, and returns the result.
   - `validateAndAdjustDates`: Validates and adjusts the start and end dates to ensure they are within a 3-month range and that the start date is not after the end date.


### TransactionRepository
The `TransactionRepository` interface extends `JpaRepository` and provides methods for accessing transaction data.

- **Methods**:
  - `findByCustomerIdAndDateBetween`: Retrieves transactions for a specific customer within a date range.
  - `findByDateBetween`: Retrieves transactions within a date range.

### Transaction
The `Transaction` class defines the data model for transactions.

- **Fields**:
  - `id`: The unique identifier for the transaction.
  - `customerId`: The ID of the customer associated with the transaction.
  - `amount`: The transaction amount.
  - `date`: The date of the transaction.

### Testing
The `RewardControllerTest` class contains unit tests for the `RewardController` using `MockMvc` to simulate HTTP requests and responses. It uses `Mockito` to mock the `RewardService` and verify the controller's behavior.
